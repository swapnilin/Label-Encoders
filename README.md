Target Encoding using category_encoders library

Target encoding is a method used in machine learning and data analysis for encoding categorical variables. It involves replacing categories or labels of a categorical variable with some meaningful numeric representation based on the target variable. The target variable refers to the variable that we want to predict or model.

The basic idea behind target encoding is to utilize the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable to derive informative features. It is particularly useful when dealing with categorical variables with high cardinality, i.e., a large number of distinct categories.

Target encoding leverages the information contained in the target variable to generate meaningful representations for categorical variables. By doing so, it allows the model to capture potential relationships between the categorical variable and the target variable, potentially improving the predictive performance of the model.
